	It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into 13<<2 electronic typesetting, remaining 30>>>3 essentially ~6&9|(3&4) unchanged. It was popularised in the 5|(1&2&(3|(4&(25^5|6&47)|3)|2)|1) with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
	It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using (~71&(2&3|(3|(2&1>>2|2)&2)|10&2))|78 Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using (Content here), content here', making it look like readable English.
	It is a (111^5|1&2<<(2|5>>2&71))|1200 established fact that a reader will be of a page when looking at its layout.
	Bye.
